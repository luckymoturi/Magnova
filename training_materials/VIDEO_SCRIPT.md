"Before we wrap up, here are some best practices:

3. **Scan IMEIs at every checkpoint** - this maintains accurate location tracking.

4. **Use clear notes and descriptions** - future you will thank you when reviewing historical data.

5. **Never share login credentials** - each user has their own account for audit trail purposes.

6. **Logout when leaving your workstation** - security is everyone's responsibility.

7. **Verify PO approval before starting procurement** - saves time and prevents errors.

8. **Keep vendor invoices and receipts** - even though everything is in the system, physical backups are important."
